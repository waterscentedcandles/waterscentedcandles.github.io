  <p class="about-text">
    hi, i’m audrey. i’m 17, and i’m literally in love with creating.<br><br>

    because honestly? what’s more fun than turning your actual ideas into reality.<br><br>

    i love filming, photography, editing, music — basically anything that lets me build a mood. visual media has always felt like the strongest kind of storytelling to me. it’s everywhere, shaping how we see the world, how we feel, and how we connect.<br><br>

    being part of the creative process just feels better. it feels like home.<br><br>

    i’m also extremely interested — in people, in systems, and in why we make the choices we do. that’s why i’m drawn to philosophy and law, and i’m hoping to study those after high school!!
